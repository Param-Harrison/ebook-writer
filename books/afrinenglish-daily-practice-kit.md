**Build Your English Speaking Habit – One Day at a Time**
**CEFR Level: A1–B1**

## Welcome!

This is not a textbook — it's your daily toolkit to speak English more, with confidence and less stress.

Each page helps you:

- Reflect on what you **say and hear**
- Practice with **real-life situations**
- Build a **daily speaking routine**
- And most importantly — **track your growth**

These pages are used by learners in the **Afrin English Speaking Challenge**, a 365-day journey to fluent, natural English.

You only need a few minutes a day to use this workbook. Speaking builds confidence. Confidence builds fluency.

Let's begin.
